# V1

Iteration 1: Basic Setup
We have a single HTML file (index.html) with a canvas element, basic styling, and a JavaScript game loop.
The game loop updates and renders the canvas 60 times per second.
Expected Behavior:
When you open the file in a web browser, you should see a blank canvas with a black background (due to the clearRect call in the render function).
The game loop is running, but there's no visible output yet.
